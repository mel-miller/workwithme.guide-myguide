## Values

- Authenticity
- Creativity
- Fairness
- Humor
- Responsibility

## Personality

Quiet at first. Sometimes awkward. But ultimately fun and laid back.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

- I don't mind public positive feedback, but it doesn't need to be over the top.
- I prefer negative feedback to be private and as soon as possible. 

## Work Patterns

- I'll typically be working approximately 9-5 Pacific time. 
- It's probably best to interact with me after 10am though. 
- I may work a little in the evening.
- Meetings between 3:30 and 4:30 may not be great because my dogs tend to get rowdy for their pending dinner time.

## Communication Preferences

- Slack is probably the best way to get ahold of me.
- If it's urgent and my notifications are snoozed, please feel free to notify anyway.

## Ask Me About

- Music (playing and listening)
- Dogs (and how cute they are)
- Urban history and old maps
